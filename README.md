# Bootstrap Regression (Fall 2025)

This repository contains a **final project** for a Linear Rgeression course, focusing on bootstrap methods in linear regression.  
It includes reproducible code, interactive visualizations, and a blog-style writeup.

---

## Project Goals
1. **Blog Post** – Deep dive into bootstrap methods for regression (pairs, residual, wild, block, cluster).
2. **Interactive Streamlit App** – Teach intuition, allow exploration of bootstrap methods, and visualize uncertainty.
3. **GitHub Repository** – Clean, reproducible code with notebooks, scripts, unit tests, and deployment instructions.
